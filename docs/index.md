# Doppler + Steampipe

[Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) is a cloud-native secrets management platform that securely centralizes and automates the management of sensitive data across teams and applications.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List your Doppler secrets:

```sql
select
  project,
  config_name,
  secret_name,
  secret_value_computed
from
  doppler_secret;
```

```

## Quick start

### Install

Download and install the latest Doppler plugin:

```sh
steampipe plugin install doppler
```

### Credentials

| Item        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credentials | Doppler requires a `project ID` and an [Doppler Token](https://docs.doppler.com/reference/auth-token-formats)                                                                                   |
| Permissions | The permission scope of access tokens is limited to the projects or environments based on token type.                                                                       |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single doppler Installation.                                                                                                                   |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/doppler.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `DOPPLER_TOKEN` and `DOPPLER_PROJECT_ID`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest doppler plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/doppler.spc`) with a single connection named `doppler`:

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/doppler.spc`:

```hcl
connection "doppler" {
  plugin = "doppler"

  # A token, either a personal or service token is required for requests. Required.
  # For setting a token see instructions at https://docs.doppler.com/reference/auth-token-formats
  # This can also be set via the `DOPPLER_TOKEN` environment variable.
  # token = "dp.pt.BBS2eoMYCQW6fLv2fghbdsjbaczdsffdeBSaap887Xkbdsa"

  # The ID of a project within a workplace is required for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the `DOPPLER_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.
  # project_id = "example-project"
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use the standard Doppler environment variables to obtain credentials **only if other arguments (`token` and `project_id`) are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export DOPPLER_TOKEN=dp.pt.abcdVDI7jCoV92ylJS9yXYZO5CZRiGm0WWWnZgsZZih
export DOPPLER_PROJECT_ID=plugin-test-project
```
