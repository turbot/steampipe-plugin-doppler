Doppler Projects are a key resource within Doppler, acting as a container for environments and their associated secrets.

## Table Usage Guide

The `doppler_project` table provides insights into Projects within Doppler's secrets management platform. As a security engineer or developer, explore project-specific details through this table, including project ID, name, and associated environment variables. Utilize it to manage and monitor the security of secrets across different projects and environments.

## Examples

### Basic info
Explore the basic details of your projects, including their creation date and unique identifiers, to gain a better understanding of your project timeline and organization. This can be particularly useful for managing multiple projects and ensuring each one is progressing as expected.

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  name,
  created_at,
  slug,
  description
from
  doppler_project;
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  name,
  created_at,
  slug,
  description
from
  doppler_project;
```

### List projects created between two specific dates
Discover the projects that were initiated within a certain time frame, specifically between two given dates. This is useful for assessing the volume and pace of project creation during a specific period.

```sql+postgres
select
  name,
  id,
  created_at
from
  doppler_project
where
  created_at between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  name,
  id,
  created_at
from
  doppler_project
where
  created_at between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31';
```

### Get particular project details
Explore particular project details to understand its creation time, description, and other key information. This is useful when you need a quick overview of a specific project without having to go through all the project data.

```sql+postgres
select
  id,
  name,
  created_at,
  description,
  slug
from
  doppler_project
where
  name = 'my_first_project';
```

```sql+sqlite
select
  id,
  name,
  created_at,
  description,
  slug
from
  doppler_project
where
  name = 'my_first_project';
```
